# TurtleCare
Turtle Care winform app and embedded system project.

Project: Embedded System with Arduino as the CPU for Camera Streaming and Socket Control.

Plan:
Finish the High Level Plan, considering phone application

need a cloud MQTT Broker to communicate between app and the embedded system

Find the specific sensor, socket hub, camera module, and other utilities

Find a board that supports all the chosen modules



Objectives:

Camera Streaming:
Capture and stream video wirelessly from a camera module to a PC.

Socket Control:
Control the power to specific sockets using an Arduino-based system.

	Sensors:
		Monitor the temperature and humidity through the Winform App
	Status Indicator:
		A few LEDs to signal the system status
	MicroSD Card Integration:
		Store captured images or video on a microSD card for local storage.
	User Interface (WinForms App):
		Develop a WinForms application for the PC to display the video stream and control socket power.
	Components and Supplies:
	Arduino System:
		Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega).
		USB hub controller with programmable features.
		Wireless module for communication (e.g., Wi-Fi module).
		The camera module is compatible with Arduino.
		MicroSD card module.
	Socket Control:
		Smart sockets or relay modules.
		Wiring and connectors.
		Power strip or extension cord.
	PC Software Development:
		PC with Visual Studio for WinForms application development.
		USB cable for connecting Arduino to PC during development.
	User Interface (WinForms App):
		Design and implement a WinForms application.
		Incorporate controls for socket management and display for the video stream.
		Implement communication logic for sending commands to Arduino.
	Power Supply:
		Adequate power supply for Arduino, USB hub, camera, and microSD card module.
	Enclosure and Mounting:
		Enclosure for housing Arduino, USB hub, and components.
		Mounting hardware if needed.
	Testing and Debugging:
		Test Arduino firmware and WinForms application separately.
		Debug any issues and ensure proper functionality.
	Security Considerations:
		Implement authentication and authorization for remote access.
		Error handling for unexpected situations.
	Documentation:
		Document code for future reference.
		Create project documentation including wiring diagrams and instructions.
	Safety and Compliance:
		Follow safety practices when working with electrical components.
		Ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
